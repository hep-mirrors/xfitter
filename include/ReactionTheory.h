  @class ReactionTheory

  @brief A base class manages for reaction theories

  It provides an interface which must be present in the derived classes
  Each concrete instance of ReactionTheory is a singleton
  ReactionTheory is responsible for:
  1. Getting and checking sanity of reaction parameters.
  2. Calculating theory predictions for given dataset
