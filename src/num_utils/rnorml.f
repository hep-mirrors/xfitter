      SUBROUTINE RNORML(DEVIAS,NDEV)
C        Generator of a vector of independent Gaussian-distributed 
C        (pseudo-)random numbers, of mean zero and variance one,
C        making use of a uniform pseudo-random generator (RANMAR).
C        The algorithm for converting uniform numbers to Gaussian
C        is that of "Ratio of Uniforms with Quadratic Bounds."  The
C        method is in principle exact (apart from rounding errors),
C        and is based on the variant published by Joseph Leva in
C        ACM TOMS vol. 18(1992), page 449 for the method and 454 for
C        the Fortran algorithm (ACM No. 712).
C        It requires at least 2 and on average 2.74 uniform deviates
C        per Gaussian (normal) deviate.
C   WARNING -- The uniform generator should not produce exact zeroes,
C   since the pair (0.0, 0.5) provokes a floating point exception.
