This is an example how to have a FFNS with 4 flavours at all scales using QCDNUM.
Chi^2 is meaningless (this is not a fit); moreover the calculation of DIS structure functions (RT) could be inconsistent with PDF evolution.
Evolved PDFs are consistent with the 'FFNS4-APFEL' example which uses APFEL.
