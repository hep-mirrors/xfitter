# Alert:
#    the dependence of inclusive ttbar x-section on `ctg` is artificial and is only 
#    used to illustrate how to fit top quark mass and SMEFT parameters simultaneously.

  # make some of the entries invisible to xFitter.
  # since any two of (Kmt1, Kmt2, l_mt, q_mt) are sufficient (and equivalent) to determine the
  # linear/quadratic corrections from mt, we need to mask the other two of them.
