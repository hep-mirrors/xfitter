One chi2 iteration NNLO RTOPT QCDNUM (default) [HERAPDF2.0 arXiv:1506.06042 ]

For testing and illustration purposes, artificially introduce polarisation for the 920 NC data and flip the charge of the 920 CC data.
These modifications lead to large partial chi2s of the corresponding tests, this is OK.

See "byDataset" block in parameters.yaml for more details
