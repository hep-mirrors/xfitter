This is an example how to have a VFNS with maximum 4 flavours in QCDNUM: 3 flavours below the charm threshold and 4 flavours above it.
Chi^2 is meaningless (this is not a fit); moreover the calculation of DIS structure functions (FONLL) could be inconsistent with PDF evolution.
Evolved PDFs are consistent with the 'VFNS4-APFEL' example which uses APFEL.
