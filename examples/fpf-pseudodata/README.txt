Illustrating profiling using the FPF pseudodata produced for arXiv:2309.09581 [hep-ph].
The subdirectories contain runfiles for profiling using only estimates for statistical uncertainties, 
or for both statistical and systematic uncertainties. 
In the latter, illustrate plotting the two cases together for comparison.

Illustrates also:
- using the PineAPPL reaction interface
- rescaling the PDF eigenvectors in parameters.yaml, corresponding to passing a non-1 Delta chi^2 criterion

All the required commands can be executed by running the script runAll.sh.
