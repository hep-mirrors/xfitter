Example how to get central theoretical predictions for charm CC production at LHeC in FONLL-B scheme from 1907.01014 (Figs. 1,2,3).
chi2 =0, data points provide only information on bins and set to theory.

The code provides also an example of how to use FONLL computation with other than APFEL (fortran) evolution as well as how to reset data to predictions.
