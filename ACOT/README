                 Running ACOT in xFitter


0) General ACOT philosophy
====================

... under construction

1) RUNNING ACOT Schemes
====================

 ! ---  HF_SCHEME = 'ACOT Full' : ACOT - F.Olness Version (massive), using k-factors  
 ! ---  HF_SCHEME = 'ACOT Chi' : ACOT - F.Olness Version (massive), using k-factors  
 ! ---  HF_SCHEME = 'ACOT ZM'   : ACOT - F.Olness Version (massless), using k-factors  

The default is with k-factors to speed up the run time. This can be disabled so that
the full calculation can be used by setting UseKFactors=.FALSE. or setting index.eq.0.


Computes both Neutral Current and Charged Current. 

For Neutral Current, you can choose either photon exchange only, 
or photon + Z. Initial beam polarization is controled by 'polar'


2) OUTPUTS
====================================

For diagnostics, the k-factors are output to ./output/KfactorsACOT.txt
This writes on unit 62. 


3) DISCLAIMERS
====================================

This is a beta version that has been "hacked" to adapt to the
xFitter framework, and is for testing purposes only.
