                 Installation and Usage Instructions

0) Pre-requirements.
====================

-- cmake version at least 2.8.12.2

-- Link to recent Root libraries (e.g. version 5.34). This is optional, but recommended to enable drawing tools, APPLgrid.

-- libyaml (required for xfitter-process) and libyaml-cpp (required for xFitter itself). If not installed on the system,
   they can be installed using tools/install-yaml script

-- libblas and liblapack. These libraries can be also compiled using tools/install-lapack, however central installation is recommended.

-- Optional, but highly recommended:
   QCDNUM version at least qcdnum-17-01/14, can be found at 
   http://www.nikhef.nl/~h24/qcdnum/QcdnumDownload.html

-- Optional: APPLgrid, LHAPDF, APFEL, APFELxx, Ceres, Hathor


1) INSTALLATION (basic installation)
====================================

  a) Run:

    ./make.sh install

		cmake will try to locate libraries automatically.

  b) make sure that "/your/installation/path/bin" is in your PATH.
    --> you should get "xfitter" executable file installed.

  c) Run a check from the source folder:

    xfitter

  d) Storing of the outputs: output/ (default, name can be changed in the steering.txt)
	- minuit.out.txt  			(minuit output)
	- Results.txt 				(chiquare and the systematic shifts)
	- lhapdf.block.txt			(ready to use LHAPDF5.X style grids, run tools/tolhapdf.cmd)
	- xfitter_pdf	          	(directory with the ready to use LHAPDF6.X style grids)
	- fittedresults.txt			(theory predictions for each fitted data point)
	- pulls.first/last.txt		(pulls at the start and end of the fit)
	- pdfs_q2val_0i.txt			(user defined PDF sets at predefined Q2 values, as set in the steering.txt)	

  e) To get more data files, one can use xfitter-getdata.sh script 
  type: ./xfitter-getdata.sh -h for help. Alternatively, data files can be downloaded from the hepforge page:

      http://xfitter.hepforge.org/data.html
